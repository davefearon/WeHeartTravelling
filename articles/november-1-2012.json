We're going to try and update the blog as often as possible during our trips.</p><p>On that note, tomorrow morning (November 2nd, 2012), we hit the road for San Francisco. It's been a long 3 weeks getting ready for this move and we're both excited and relieved that the day has finally arrived.</p><p>We're going to miss all of our family and friends that live in Ottawa (and Canada for that matter), but we're only a 7 hour flight away.</p><p><i class='icon-heart'></i></p>"
